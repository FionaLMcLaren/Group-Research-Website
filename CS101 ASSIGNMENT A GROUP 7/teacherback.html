          Digital learning is not a new concept; it is a concept with untapped potential.
<br>Transitioning from traditional to digital learning was difficult. Covid-19 remote learning brought many challenges for unprepared teachers. Both teachers and students were frustrated.
<br>Should we then abandon the idea of digitalizing our schools? No.
<br>The world will never be immune to epidemics and natural disasters (25). Furthermore, by abandoning the concept of digital learning, we would deny learners the opportunity to use such a system.
<br>The digital learning landscape has changed since Covid-19. We have learned lessons. Teachers can, and should, prepare to adapt to digital learning in a post-covid world.

        <p>
          Digital learning is where students and teachers use technology to teach and learn. In digital learning, there are two types of learning. The first is online, in which learning is entirely electronic. The second is blended, which fuses digital and traditional learning (19).
          <br>An early example of digital learning is the Electronic University Network. Ron Gordon created the platform in 1982 to create online courses that made learning more accessible (12).
          <br>Education went digital in 1986 with the launch of the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET). Jones International University became the first accredited digital university in 1993. The California Virtual University opened its doors in 1998 with about 700 online classes. MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) launched OpenCourseWare in 2002, providing free online courses worldwide (13).
          <br>In 2017, 3.1 million students were completing their education fully online and one-third of students took at least one online course (10). Digital learning had taken off, but what made it so appealing?

          <br><br>In England, tuition fees and living costs can amount to about Â£56,910 for an average university student (11). Students living in rural areas far from nearby schools can struggle to get to class.  Long campus commutes put off students with jobs and families (7). By going digital, students could band schoolwork and life together and cut costs.
          <br>The Spring of 2020 saw 1.2 billion students not in school because of the Covid-19 outbreak (6). Overnight, education became digital. The number of online learners had exploded.
          <br>Yet, digital learning will fail without proper planning (19). This was the story for many teachers, unprepared for the Covid-19 pandemic and a new sort of learning.
          <br>Digital learning is still learning and follows the same principles. Students need feedback when they are confused, and there must be equality among students. Students need to work independently and as part of a team. Learning objectives should be clear and build on previous concepts. The curriculum must include routines and assessments (15).
          <br>We must rethink the way we learn in the digital age.
