        These changes have had many constraints and impacts on students.
        <h5 id="section1">The School from Home (SFH) System</h5>
        <p>The School from Home (SFH) system allows teachers to stay in contact with their children during an outbreak of a disease or pandemic. The SFH system was developed by the Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture to allow education to continue during social distance restrictions imposed by the government. The SFH system has, however, failed to meet the expectations of primary school pupils, teachers and parents alike.

        <h5 id="section2">Parents and Students</h5>
        <p>A study argued that parents would have to spend large amounts of time to assist their children. With limited peer interaction and long hours spent in front of a screen, young students were unmotivated to engage in online learning. The parents would not only have to motivate them but also deal with technical issues. If the technology could not be repaired, younger pupils would be barred from the SFH system. However, not all parents were technologically savvy enough to handle all problems.

</div><br><br>

        <h5 id="section3">Teachers</h5>
        <p>Even teachers were not all technologically inclined. These teachers tried to adapt their teaching style to the virtual environment. Yet, due to their inexperience with technology, they were likely to leave important information out. Having few e-resources available in Indonesian, these teachers were forced to improvise their digital teaching style.
