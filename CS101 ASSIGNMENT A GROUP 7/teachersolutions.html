<p>
  As well as teachers, students need a solid foundation in digital learning. A student familiar with technology will find it easier to use (23). The key to successful digital learning is confidence as self-assured learners will perform better (21).
 <br>One of the best ways teachers learn is by collaborating with colleagues. Trust and Whalen found that 68% of teachers consulted their colleagues for ideas and resources (25). Together, teachers can design a coherent digital learning environment for their schools. The students will then no longer feel disoriented and will be able to learn with conviction.

</div><br><br>
<p>
A teacher can also take an online course to learn how to use digital learning software. Teachers can improve their digital lectures and tutorials by using Zoom’s webinars (4). These webinars are free and run daily. Teams and Office users can take part in Microsoft’s online forums to ask and answer questions (3). By participating in digital learning themselves, teachers can see what works and what does not.
  </p>







        <h5 id="section2">Student Engagement</h5>
        <p>
          An FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) page or discussion forum can clear up confusion for students (16).
      <br>    They can be used by teachers to specify class expectations as well as by students to ask questions. Questions from students can be posted on the FAQ page. This one page serves as the first stop for students to find answers to their questions.
      <br>    When students see their questions noticed and answered, they will feel involved. The whole class can see the discussions and join in if they want.
  <br></p>

<p>
      <br>    Younger students will have a harder time interacting with technology than older students. Accordingly, digital learning should be approached differently based on age and needs. Parents can also benefit from discussion forums as they will know who to contact if their child struggles (16). Parents are more inclined to contact teachers if they know they may reach out to them with any questions (23). Teachers can host virtual parents meetings via phone or Zoom. In these meetings, <br>parents can find out how their child is doing in online school (23). This will ensure that parents stay connected to their children's education. So, students will feel more responsible for their work because any problems will be brought up to their parents.  It will help both a parent and a child know the next steps.
  <br>
          <br>Learning can be made more interactive by reinventing the online classroom.
        <br>  Offering students virtual field trips can be an exciting way to let them see life outside of their homes (16). The pandemic may have forced museums and zoos to close, but many of them carried on virtually. The Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Gardens offered zoo animal classes online every day (16). Virtual field trips could allow students to explore Hawaii to China (16). Students vocabulary will expand by visiting these new places, even though it is a virtual excursion (16). Teachers <br>can use this resource for free, so they are not burdened by making original online lessons.</p>

         Video conferencing apps are not just for teachers broadcasting themselves. Teachers should encourage students to unmute their microphones so they can talk to each other, just as they would in person. This opens the door for students to ask questions and contribute ideas in real-time. The goal of digital learning is not only to teach but to get students to interact with each other. It is best to engage students in conversations with their peers as much as possible so they don't   <br>feel isolated during digital learning (24). Teachers can use virtual show-and-tells to gain insight into young students' minds, helping them to know how to support each student better (24).

<p>
         Teachers can also communicate with students asynchronously so that they are not left out. If students do not have access to the internet, teachers could text or call them. If a student cannot access email, worksheets can be sent. For example, Portugal's schools and post offices teamed up to send the worksheets during the pandemic (18). To avoid excess screen time, not all activities should be done online (16). Printable worksheets can help students save hours wasted on screens.   With all students spending time away from computers, those without will feel less left out.
          <br>  Teachers can record their tutorials so that students can watch them and catch up later. Zoom enables teachers to save live transcripts of their lectures. Colibri can polish these transcripts into legible notes (2).
            <br>Teachers can also call their students to talk one-on-one about their progress. Weekly calls can hold students accountable for their studies (24). Such conversations can help students reflect and plan better next steps. Teachers can also use these conversations to reassure and build rapport with struggling students.

        <h5 id="section3">Online Exams</h5>
<p>
  Online exam control procedures (ONCP) will prevent cheating (14). A teacher can, for instance, limit exam times, limit student access, and change test attributes for different students (14).
<br>  Using Digify Document Security, screenshotting or messaging exam documents can be made impossible (1).
<br>  ProctorExam is more than a virtual invigilator. Its documentation gives both exam takers and exam organizers guidance and ideas (9).

  </div>
</div><br><br>

 <p>Zoom makes it possible for teachers to oversee students as if they were in person. When the cameras are turned on, teachers can watch students for suspicious behaviour during the exam. Similar to invigilators, students can also notify their teachers if they have any problems, simply by clicking a button (8). Teachers can use Zoom to support students who need additional assistance with exams, such as acting as scribes.

<h5 id="section4">Conclusion</h5>
<p>
  Covid-19 exposed flaws in digital learning, but we must not give up. Digital learning could be the response that many students are looking for: flexible, cheap and accessible. Digital learning has challenges, but so does traditional learning. However, Teachers should adapt the program to fit the needs of the time. Digital learning is here to stay, even as we enter a post-Covid world. In this post-Covid world, we should prepare for a new era. The digital age.
