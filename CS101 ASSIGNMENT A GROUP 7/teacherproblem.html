        <p>
          Teachers were unprepared for the transition to digital learning. Like their students, they struggled.
        <br>  In Trust and Whalenâ€™s study, 61% of teachers were overwhelmed by all the digital learning resources (25). About half of the teachers had little or no insight into digital learning strategies (25). Teachers were supposed to help students adapt to digital learning, yet they did not know how. Teacher collaboration was confined to the digital world. Due to the distance, interacting with other teachers was harder. Teachers chose software according to their judgment. Learning environments could vary widely from class to class. This led to inconsistent digital learning for students.
        <br>  Using the same old methods in digital classes will not work (20). Successful online teachers have technological and pedagogical knowledge, and discipline-specific knowledge (19). But, most teachers lacked this specialized skill set and were unprepared to teach digitally (25). It was too late to train teachers with these skills when Covid-19 struck. For teachers unfamiliar with digital communication, who could they turn to?

        <h5 id="section2">Student Engagement </h5>
        <p>
          Although teachers may be computer savvy, their students may not be.
          <br> 53% of the teachers Trust and Whalen interviewed reported that their students had a slow internet connection (25). Students fall behind when they cannot access digital learning. Buffering lecture videos hinder studentsâ€™ engagement and motivation.
          For students from disadvantaged backgrounds, this is particularly problematic. Among American children between 6 and 17 years old in 2017, 14% did not have internet access at home (16). Laptops are out of reach for students from low-income backgrounds. Low-income students relied on their schools to provide computers and internet access (22). Desktop applications will be unavailable to download, even if they own a mobile phone. Not every student will have a system that can run digital learning applications, either. Hence, they may miss lectures and assessments (22).
        <br>  It is harder to hold students accountable when they are just on a screen. During class, students can go on their phones much easier (23). Lectures can be muted, trouble-free. Students who disengaged during Covid-19 online learning could have lost half of their math ability and a third of their reading ability (17). Once students returned to in-person classes, they found it difficult to adjust.
        <br>  Over 80% of Californiaâ€™s children were behind in school due to the Covid-19 pandemic (5). When learning went offline, teachers have little time to get all students back on track. Why not just repeat the lessons? Yet, the students who engaged with the digital learning environment should not be forgotten. Not only does rehashing the material disrupt the curriculum, but it also unfairly penalizes hardworking students.

Teachers are unable to supervise online exams the same way, so cheating is not impossible.

<br>Ewing and Cooper found that teachers were unsure about online exam grades (25). Teachers never knew if students received outside help or not. Teachers could thus not keep track of their studentsâ€™ progress.
