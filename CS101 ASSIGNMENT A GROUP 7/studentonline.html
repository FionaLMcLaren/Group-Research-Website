  <p>
    During the pandemic, online learning took over most students' education. Teaching very quickly switched over from in person teaching to purely online in a short space of a couple of months.
    <br>This massively affected the demands for online learning resources and saw the rise in online teaching aids with software such as Microsoft teams seeing a 37% increase in users in just one week during the height of the pandemic. The approach to online teaching differed slightly depending on the school or staff but overwhelmingly 70% of teachers opted for pre-recording lectures and classes.
  </p>
  <h5 id="section2">Innovations</h5>
  <p>
This allowed for students to design their own timetables and move through their lessons at their own pace. This had a split effect on students allowing some of them control over their own learning while others struggled with the self-discipline necessary to keep up. For the 20% who opted for live online lessons only 13% of students reported not getting enough of a break between lessons.

Overwhelmingly though students preferred regular in person classes with 94% finding them more comfortable than online lessons.
    92.1% think that direct face to face learning is important for effective learning. Online learning had an overall negative impact on studentsâ€™ mental health during the pandemic. 75.3% of students said they felt online learning has made one or more of their subjects increasingly more difficult than they would have been had the classes been in person. Even though the technology for online learning was successful and in theory just as good as in person teaching overall it just did not compare.
